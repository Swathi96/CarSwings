User Interface (UI) is the means by which the user and a computer system interact, in particular the use of input devices and software. 

BAO or the business access object is to validate the imputs entered by the user. 

DAO or Data access object  is an object that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, the DAO provides some specific data operations without exposing details of the database. It separates what data access the application needs, in terms of domain-specific objects and data types, from how these needs can be satisfied with a specific DBMS, database schema, etc.  

Entity is repsonsible for communication among various layers of the architecture.
